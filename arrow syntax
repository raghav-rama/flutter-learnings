Arrow syntax(Dart)
You might have seen the => symbol in Dart code. This arrow syntax is a way to define a function that executes the expression to its right and returns its value.

bool hasEmpty = aListOfStrings.any((s) {
  return s.isEmpty;
});
Here’s a simpler way to write that code:

bool hasEmpty = aListOfStrings.any((s) => s.isEmpty);
